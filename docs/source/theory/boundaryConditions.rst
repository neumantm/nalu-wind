Supported Boundary Conditions
-----------------------------

Inflow Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Continuity
~~~~~~~~~~

Continuity uses a flux boundary condition with the incoming mass flow
rate based on the user specified values for velocity,

.. math:: \dot{m}_c = \rho^{spec} u^{spec}_j A_j.

As this is a vertex-based code, at inflow and Dirichlet wall boundary
locations, the continuity equation uses the specified velocity within
the inflow boundary condition block.

Momentum, Mixture Fraction, Enthalpy, Species, :math:`k_{sgs}`, k and :math:`\omega`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These degree-of-freedoms (DOFs) each use a Dirichlet value with the
specified user value. For all Dirichlet values, the row is zeroed with a
unity placed on the diagonal. The residual is zeroed and set to the
difference between the current value and user specified value.


Wall Boundary Conditions
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Continuity
~~~~~~~~~~

Continuity uses a no-op.

.. _wall_bc_momentum:

Momentum
~~~~~~~~

When resolving the boundary layer, Momentum again uses a no-slip
Dirichlet condition., e.g., :math:`u_i = 0`.

In the case of a wall model, a classic wall function is applied. The
wall shear stress enters the discretization of the momentum equations by
the term

.. math::
   :label: wall-shear1

   \int \tau_{ij} n_j dS = -{F_w}_i .


Wall functions are used to prescribe the value of the wall shear stress
rather than resolving the boundary layer within the near-wall domain.
The fundamental momentum law of the wall formulation, assuming
fully-developed turbulent flow near a no-slip wall, can be written as,

.. math::
   :label: law-wall

   u^+ = \frac{u_{\|}}{u_{\tau}} 
       = \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln \left(Ey^+\right) ,


where :math:`u^+` is defined by the the near-wall parallel velocity,
:math:`u_{\|}`, normalized by the wall friction velocity,
:math:`u_{\tau}`. The wall friction velocity is related to the turbulent
kinetic energy by,

.. math::
   :label: utau

   u_{\tau} = C_\mu^{1/4} k^{1/2}.


by assuming that the production and dissipation of turbulence is in
local equilibrium. The wall friction velocity is also computed given the
density and wall shear stress,

.. math:: u_\tau = (\frac{\tau_w} {\rho})^{0.5}.

The normalized perpendicular distance from the point in question to the
wall, :math:`y^+`, is defined as the following:

.. math::
   :label: yplus

   y^+ = \frac{ \rho Y_p}{\mu }\left(\frac{\tau_w}{\rho} \right)^{1/2} 
       = \frac{ \rho Y_p u_{\tau}} {\mu }.

The classical law of the wall is as follows:

.. math::
   :label: lawOfWall1

   u^+ = \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln(y^+) + C,


where :math:`\kappa` is the von Karman constant and :math:`C` is the
dimensionless integration constant that varies based on authorship and
surface roughness. The above expression can be re-written as,

.. math::
   :label: lawOfWall2

   u^+ = \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln(y^+) + \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln(\exp(\kappa C)),


or simplified to the following expression:

.. math::
   :label: lawOfWall3

   u^+ &= \frac{1}{\kappa} \left(\ln(y^+) + \ln(\exp(\kappa C))\right) \\
   &= \frac{1}{\kappa} \ln(E y^+).


In the above equation, :math:`E`, is referred to in the text as the
dimensionless wall roughness parameter and is described by,

.. math::
   :label: ElogParam

   E = \exp(\kappa C).


In Nalu-Wind, :math:`\kappa` is set to the value of 0.42 while the value of
:math:`E` is set to 9.8 for smooth walls (White suggests values of
:math:`\kappa=0.41` and :math:`E=7.768.`). The viscous sublayer is
assumed to extend to a value of :math:`y^+` = 11.63.

The wall shear stress, :math:`\tau_w`, can be expressed as,

.. math::
   :label: wall-shear-trb

   \tau_w = \rho u_\tau^2 = \rho u_\tau {\frac{u_\|} {u^+}}
          = \frac{\rho \kappa u_{\tau}}{\ln \left(Ey^+\right) } u_\|
          = \lambda_w u_\| ,


where :math:`\lambda_w` is simply the grouping of the factors from the
law of the wall. For values of :math:`y^+` less than 11.63, the wall
shear stress is given by,

.. math::
   :label: wall-shear-lam

   \tau_w =  \mu \frac{u_\|}{Y_p} .


The force imparted by the wall, for the :math:`i_{th}` component of
velocity, can be written as,

.. math::
   :label: wall-force-1

   F_{w,i}= -\lambda_w A_w u_{i\|} ,


where :math:`A_w` is the total area over which the shear stress acts.

The use of a general, non-orthogonal mesh adds a slight complexity to
specifying the force imparted on the fluid by the wall. As shown in
Equation :eq:`wall-force-1`, the velocity component parallel to the wall
must be determined. Use of the unit normal vector, :math:`n_j`, provides
an easy way to determine the parallel velocity component by the
following standard vector projection:

.. math::
   :label: proj-oper

   \Pi_{ij} = \left [ \delta_{ij} - n_i n_j \right].

Carrying out the projection of a general velocity, which is not
necessarily parallel to the wall, yields the velocity vector parallel to
the wall,

.. math::
   :label: proj-operU

   u_{i\|} = \Pi_{ij} {u}_j = u_i\left(1-{n_i}^2\right)
           -\sum_{j=1;j\neq j}^{n} u_j n_i n_j.


Note that the component that acts on the particular :math:`i^{th}`
component of velocity,

.. math::
   :label: implicit-shear

   -\lambda_w A_w \left(1-n_i n_i\right) u_{i\|} ,


provides a form that can be potentially treated implicitly; i.e., in a
way to augment the diagonal dominance of the central coefficient of the
:math:`i^{th}` component of velocity. The use of residual form adds a
slight complexity to this implicit formulation only in that appropriate
right-hand-side source terms must be added.

Mixture Fraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a value is specified for each quantity within the wall boundary
condition block, a Dirichlet condition is applied. If no values are
specified, a zero flux condition is applied.

Enthalpy
~~~~~~~~

If the temperature is specified within the wall boundary condition
block, a Dirichlet condition is always specified. Wall functions for
enthalpy transport have not yet been implemented.

The simulation tool supports multi-physics coupling via conjugate heat
transfer and radiative heat transfer. Coupling parameters required for
the thermal boundary condition are post processed by the fluids or PMR
Realm. For conjugate and radiative coupling, the thermal solve provides
the surface temperature. From the surface temperature, a wall enthalpy
is computed and used.

Thermal Heat Conduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a temperature is specified in the wall block, and the surface is not
an interface condition, then a Dirichlet approach is used. If conjugate
heat transfer is included, then the boundary condition applied is as
follows,

.. math:: -\kappa \frac{\partial T} {\partial x_j} n_j dS = h(T-T^o)dS,

where :math:`h` is the heat transfer coefficient and :math:`T^o` is the
reference temperature. The details of how these quantities are computed
are currently omitted in this manual. In general, the quantities are
post processed from the fluids temperature field. A surface-based
gradient is computed on the boundary face. Nodes on the face augment a
heat transfer coefficient field while nodes off the face contribute to a
reference temperature.

For radiative heat transfer, the boundary condition applied is as
follows:

.. math:: -\kappa \frac{\partial T} {\partial x_j} n_j dS = \epsilon (\sigma T^4 - H) dS,

where :math:`H` is again the irradiation provided by the RTE solve.

If no temperature is specified or an adiabatic line command is used, a
zero flux condition is applied.

Species
~~~~~~~

If a value is specified for each quantity within the wall boundary
condition block, a Dirichlet condition is applied. If no values are
specified, a zero flux condition is applied.

Atmospheric Boundary Layer Surface Conditions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Monin-Obukhov Theory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider atmospheric flow over a flat but non-smooth surface; the
coordinate system convention is that flow is along the :math:`x`-axis, while
the :math:`z`-axis is oriented normal to the surface.  The surface layer is
the relatively thin layer near the surface where strong wind and
temperature gradients exist.  Turbulence within this layer can be
generated through mechanisms of both shear and thermal convection; the
relative contributions of these two mechanisms is determined by the
stability state of the atmosphere.  The stability state is
characterized by the Monin-Obukhov length:

.. math::

   L = - \frac{u_\tau^3 \theta_{ref}}{\kappa g (\overline{w^\prime
     \theta^\prime})_s};

:math:`u_\tau` is the friction velocity, defined as the
square root of the magnitude of the Reynolds shear stress at
the surface, or

.. math::

   u_\tau = \left( \overline{w^\prime u^\prime}^2 + \overline{w^\prime
   v^\prime}^2 \right)^{1/4} = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_s}{\rho_s}}

:math:`\theta_{ref}` is a reference (virtual potential) temperature associated with the air
within the surface layer; for example, the average temperature within
the surface layer.  :math:`\kappa \approx 0.41` is the von Karman constant,
and :math:`g` is the acceleration of gravity.  :math:`\overline{w^\prime \theta^\prime}_s`
is the surface turbulent temperature flux.  Both the
turbulent shear stress and turbulent temperature flux are approximately
constant within the surface layer.

Applying a gradient diffusion model for the turbulent temperature flux leads to:

.. math::

   \overline{w^\prime \theta^\prime}_s = -k_T \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z}

The sign of :math:`L` is then connected to the sign of the temperature
gradient within the surface layer.  Three regimes are delineated:

* :math:`\frac{1}{L} > 0, \quad \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} > 0`, stable stratification
* :math:`\frac{1}{L} = 0, \quad \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} = 0`, neutral stratification
* :math:`\frac{1}{L} < 0, \quad \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} < 0`, unstable stratification

Monin-Obukhov theory postulates the following similarity laws for mean
velocity parallel to the surface and temperature,

.. math::
   :label: dudz

   \frac{\kappa z}{u_\tau}\frac{\partial \overline{u}_{||}}{\partial z} =
   \phi_m\left(\frac{z}{L}\right),

.. math::
   :label: dTdz

   \frac{\kappa z u_\tau}{\overline{w^\prime \theta^\prime}_s}
   \frac{\partial \overline{\theta}}{\partial z} = \phi_h\left(\frac{z}{L}\right),

where the forms of the non-dimensional functions :math:`\phi_m` and :math:`\phi_h` are determined
from empirical observations. Analytical functions have been fit to the
data; these are not given here, rather, we present the integrated form
of (:eq:`dudz`) and (:eq:`dTdz`), since these are the forms required
by the code implementation.

For neutral stratification, :math:`\phi_m = 1` and we recover the
logarithmic profile for a "fully rough" surface,

.. math::
   :label: vel_neutral

   \overline{u}_{||}(z) = \frac{u_\tau}{\kappa}\ln\frac{z}{z_0},

where :math:`z_0` is the characteristic roughness height.  Note that viscous
scaling involving surface viscosity and density properties is not
required with this form of the logarithmic profile, since the
roughness height is large enough to eliminate the presence of a
laminar sublayer and buffer layer.

For stable stratification, the surface layer profiles take the form

.. math::
   :label: vel_stable

   \overline{u}_{||}(z) = \frac{u_\tau}{\kappa}\left(\ln\frac{z}{z_0} +
   \gamma_m\frac{z}{L}\right)

.. math::
   :label: temp_stable

   \overline{\theta}(z) = \overline{\theta}(z_0) +
   \frac{\theta_*}{\kappa} \left(\alpha_h\ln\frac{z}{z_0} +
   \gamma_h\frac{z}{L}\right)

:math:`\theta_*` is calculated from the temperature flux and friction velocity as
:math:`\theta_* = -\frac{\overline{w^\prime \theta^\prime}_s}{u_\tau}`, and
:math:`\gamma_m`, :math:`\alpha_h`, and :math:`\gamma_h` are constants specified below.

For unstable stratification, the surface layer profiles take the form

.. math::
   :label: vel_unstable

   \overline{u}_{||}(z) = \frac{u_\tau}{\kappa}\left(\ln\frac{z}{z_0} -
   \psi_m\left(\frac{z}{L}\right)\right)

.. math::
   :label: temp_unstable

   \overline{\theta}(z) = \overline{\theta}(z_0) +
   \alpha_h\frac{\theta_*}{\kappa}\left(\ln\frac{z}{z_0} -
   \psi_h\left(\frac{z}{L}\right)\right)

where

.. math::
   :label: psi_m

   \psi_m\left(\frac{z}{L}\right) = 2\ln\frac{1 + x}{2}
   + \ln\frac{1 + x^2}{2} - 2\tan^{-1}x +
   \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad x = \left(1 - \beta_m\frac{z}{L}\right)^{1/4},

.. math::
   :label: psi_h

   \psi_h\left(\frac{z}{L}\right) = \ln\frac{1 + y}{2}, \quad y = \left(1 -
   \beta_h\frac{z}{L}\right)^{1/2}.


The constants used in (:eq:`vel_stable`) -- (:eq:`psi_h`) are :cite:`Dyer:74`

.. math::

   \kappa = 0.41,~~\alpha_h =
   1,~~\beta_m=16,~~\beta_h=16,~~\gamma_m=5.0,~~\gamma_h=5.0.

.. _theory_abl_wall_function:

ABL Wall Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The equations from the preceeding section can be used to formulate a
wall function boundary condition for simulation of atmospheric
boundary layers.  The user-specified inputs to this boundary condition
are: roughness length, :math:`z_0`, and surface heat flux, :math:`q_s =
\rho C_p (\overline{w^\prime \theta^\prime})_s`.  The surface layer profile
model is evaluated for each surface boundary flux integration point;
the wall-normal distance of the "first point off the wall" is taken
to be one fourth of the length of the nearest edge intersecting the
boundary face.  The boundary condition is specified weakly through the
imposition of a surface shear stress and surface heat flux.

The procedure for applying the boundary condition is as follows:

1. Determine the stratification state of the boundary layer by calculating the sign of the Monin-Obukhov length scale.
2. Solve the appropriate profile equation, either (:eq:`vel_neutral`), (:eq:`vel_stable`), or (:eq:`vel_unstable`), for the friction velocity :math:`u_\tau`.  For the neutral case, :math:`u_\tau` can be solved for directly.  For the stable and unstable cases, :math:`u_\tau` must be solved for iteratively because :math:`L` appears in these equations and :math:`L` depends on :math:`u_\tau`.
3. The surface shear stress is calculated as :math:`\tau_s = \rho_s u_\tau^2`.  For calculating left-hand-side Jacobian entries, the form :eq:`tau_s_useful` is used, where :math:`\psi^\prime` is zero for a neutral profile, :math:`-\gamma_m z/L` for a stable profile, and :math:`\psi_h(z/L)` for an unstable profile. The Jacobian entries follow directly from this form.
4. The user specified surface heat flux is applied to the enthalpy equation. Evaluation of surface temperature is not required for the boundary condition specification. However, if surface temperature is required for evaluation of other quantities within the code, the appropriate surface layer temperature profile should be used, either (:eq:`temp_stable`) or (:eq:`temp_unstable`).

.. math::
   :label: tau_s_useful

   \tau_{s_i} = \lambda_s u_{||_i} = \frac{\kappa\rho u_\tau}{\log(z/z_0) - \psi^\prime (z/L)},

.. _theory_abltop_bc:

Atmospheric Boundary Layer Top Conditions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The abltop option is intended for the upper boundary of atmospheric 
boundary layer simulations.  Currently it has two functions: 
(1) to provide a fully-automated open boundary condition that allows
for inflows and outflows generated by terrain features or obstacles
placed within the domain interior, and (2) to allow for mean temperature
gradients at the upper boundary.  These two features will be described
separately below.

Inflow-Outflow Capability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The inflow-outflow capability is facilitated by a potential flow solution
on a sub-domain consisting of a thin slab extending from the upper
boundary a short distance into the domain.
The vertical velocity at the slab bottom face is measured directly from 
the solution at each time step and this information is used to form a
potential flow solution for the entire slab, which effectively provides 
all three velocity components at the main domain upper boundary.  The
potential flow solution is achieved at very little computational cost
via Fast Fourier Transforms.  The mathematical aspects of the boundary
condition solution procedure are sketched below.

We start by assuming that the flow near the upper boundary is either
laminar or weakly turbulent, as is the norm in atmospheric boundary
layer simulations due to the presence of capping inversions (a region
of increased stability that effectively terminates the boundary layer).
If any turbulence within the slab is weak then the flow is approximately
irrotational and any density fluctuations are weak.  Furthermore, if the
slab is thin (compared with the density scale height :math:`\sim 8` km) then the
mean density variation is also negligible.  Thus we idealize the flow
as being irrotational and of constant density, which leads to the following
potential flow framework

.. math::
   \nabla^2 \phi = 0,

.. math::
   \vec{u} = \nabla \phi + \langle\vec{u}\rangle,

where :math:`\phi` is the disturbance potential and 
:math:`\langle\vec{u}\rangle` is the mean velocity.

A Fourier transform of Laplace's equation in :math:`x` and :math:`y` leads to

.. math::
   -(k^2+l^2)\hat{\phi} + \frac{\partial^2\hat{\phi}}{\partial z^2} = 0,

where :math:`k` and :math:`l` are the wavenumber components in the
:math:`x` and :math:`y` directions respectively, and where 
:math:`\hat{\phi}` is the Fourier transform of :math:`\phi`.

The bounded solution to the above equation is

.. math::
   \hat{\phi}(k,l,z) = \hat{\phi}_0\exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right],

where :math:`\hat{\phi}_0` is the Fourier transform of :math:`\phi` 
on the horizontal plane :math:`z=z_0`.  The vertical velocity component 
(in Fourier :math:`x-y` space) is 

.. math::
   \hat{w}(k,l,z) = \frac{\partial\hat{\phi}}{\partial z} = 
   -\sqrt{k^2+l^2}\hat{\phi}_0\exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right].

When evaluated at the position :math:`z=z_0` the above relation yields the 
following specification for :math:`\hat{\phi}_0`

.. math::
   \hat{\phi}_0 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2+l^2}}\hat{w}_0.

Making use of this result, the solution for :math:`\hat{\phi}` can be written
as

.. math::
   \hat{\phi}(k,l,z) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{k^2+l^2}}\hat{w}_0
                       \exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right]

If we identify :math:`z_0` with the position of the potential flow slab lower
face (the sampling plane), then the above prescription for 
:math:`\hat{\phi}` yields the solution anywhere in the slab using just 
knowledge of :math:`\hat{w}` at its lower boundary.  The three velocity 
components are

.. math::
   \hat{u}(k,l,z) & = &\frac{\partial \hat{\phi}}{\partial x} =
     -\frac{ik}{\sqrt{k^2+l^2}}\hat{w}_0
     \exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right] + \langle u\rangle \\
   \hat{v}(k,l,z) & = &\frac{\partial \hat{\phi}}{\partial x} =
     -\frac{il}{\sqrt{k^2+l^2}}\hat{w}_0
     \exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right] + \langle v\rangle \\
   \hat{w}(k,l,z) & = &\frac{\partial \hat{\phi}}{\partial x} =
     \hat{w}_0\exp\left[-\sqrt{k^2+l^2}(z-z_0)\right] + \langle w\rangle

Notice that all three velocity components contain a common
wavenumber-dependent exponential damping term.  This feature indicates
that high wavenumber (small-scale) information on the sampling plane is
strongly filtered in constructing the velocity field at the upper
boundary.  Thus the boundary condition velocity field will always be
smoother that the velocity on the sampling plane.  The filtering also
increases with larger separations between the sampling plane and the upper
boundary.  This fact poses the need to compromise between the additional
computational cost of adding a thicker potential flow region and the 
reduced filtering resulting from a thin slab.  We have found that 
a potential flow region thickness of 10\% of the overall computational
domain height provides a good compromise between these two competing
aspects of the solution.


The solution procedure is rather simple:

1. Measure :math:`w(x,y,z=z_0)`, at the position of the sampling plane.
2. Take the 2D Fourier transform of :math:`w` to get :math:`\hat{w}_0(k,l)`.
3. Solve for the three velocity components given above using the 
   computational domain upper boundary position for :math:`z` and the sampling
   plane position for :math:`z_0`.
4. Inverse Fourier transform all three solution components.

While this solution procedure is simple and can be computed at very low
cost using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), it does have some
obvious restrictions, namely

1. Data must be sampled on a uniform Cartesian grid at a fixed elevation.
2. Periodic or symmetry boundary conditions must exist in the lateral
   directions.

The simplest way to achieve the first constraint is to add a Cartesian mesh
block to the upper portion of the main computational domain.  The thickness
of the addition can be rather small, say about 10\% of the original domain 
height.  The current implementation assumes that a plane at constant 
elevation with a uniform Cartesian mesh exists near the upper boundary.
However, if required in the future, interpolation can be used to sample the
solution on a horizontal plane.  The BdyLayerVelocitySampler class can do
this.

While the second constraint may seem restrictive, it allows for any combination
of periodic or inflow/outflow boundary conditions in either of the two
lateral directions.  Half-wave instead of periodic transforms are used for 
an inflow/outflow direction.  For example, for inflow/outflow in the :math:`x`
direction, we take :math:`u\sim\cos(\pi k x/xL)`, 
:math:`v\sim\sin(\pi k x/xL)`, :math:`w\sim\sin(\pi k x/xL)`.  
These prescriptions dictate that :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0` at 
:math:`x=0` (the inlet) and at :math:`x=xL` (the outlet) and that 
:math:`v=0`, :math:`w=0` at the inlet and outlet.  In order to meet these
constraints, the terrain should be horizontal for a short distance downstream
of the inlet and a short distance upstream of the outlet.  The appropriate
combination of half-wave and full-wave (periodic) transforms in the two 
coordinate directions allow for various combinations of inflow/outflow or
periodic conditions in these directions.

Temperature Gradient Capability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The temperature almost always varies with height within the atmosphere.
The temperature gradient option allows the simulation to be consistent
with this fact specifying the rate of change in temperature at the upper
boundary.

Implementation Details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ABL top boundary condition is activated by the keyword
abltop\_boundary\_condition in the input file.  The following is an
example block of an ABL top boundary condition specification:

  | \- abltop\_boundary\_condition: bc\_upper
  | target\_name: top
  | abltop\_user\_data:

      | potential\_flow\_bc: true
      | grid\_dimensions: [121, 2, 61]
      | horizontal\_bcs: [1, -1, 0, 0]
      | z\_sample: 0.85
      | normal\_temperature\_gradient: 0.01

The potential flow and temperature gradient options can be used independently
or together.  The Boolean input potential\_flow\_bc: true activates the
potential flow feature, whereas the presence of the keyword 
normal\_temperature\_gradient: value activates the temperature gradient 
feature.  If only the temperature gradient feature is called for, then
symmetry conditions (i.e. a slip wall) are used continuity and momentum 
boundary conditions at the upper boundary.  If only the potential flow 
boundary condition is called for then the condition 
:math:`d\langle T\rangle/dz=0` is used at the upper boundary (where 
:math:`\langle\rangle` indicates a horizontal average).

If the potential flow option is selected, the user must then specify 
three additional user inputs: grid\_dimensions, horizontal\_bcs and z\_sample.  
The grid\_dimensions input specifies the number of mesh points in the 
three coordinate directions for the structured
Cartesian portion of the domain containing the potential flow slab.  This
may be the entire domain, or just a sub-portion of it.  The current 
implementation assumes that the grid points within the structured Cartesian
region are tagged with a mesh index flag that indicates the relative position 
of each point within the structured mesh system.  For example, if 
(imax,jmax,kmax) are the grid dimensions in the three coordinate directions, 
then the mesh index for the point (i,j,k) is k*imax*jmax + j*imax + i.  
The abl\_mesh program will include the mesh index tag in the exodus grid file.

The horizontal\_bcs input specifies the lateral boundary conditions in
use in the i and j grid directions.  Inflow is specified with +1, outlfow
-1, and periodic with zero.  Thus in the example above, inflow is used at
the i=0 boundary, outflow at the i=imax boundary, and periodic conditions
are used in the j direction.

The input z\_sample specifies the elevation of the sampling plane.  If this
input is missing, the default position of 90\% of the distance between
the lower and upper boundary will be used.

Turbulent Kinetic Energy, :math:`k_{sgs}` LES model
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the boundary layer is assumed to be resolved, the natural boundary
condition is a Dirichlet value of zero, :math:`k_{sgs} = 0`.

When the wall model is used, a standard wall function approach is used
with the assumption of equal production and dissipation.

The turbulent kinetic energy production term is consistent with the law
of the wall formulation and can be expressed as,

.. math::
   :label: wall-pk-1

   {P_k}_w = \tau_w \frac{\partial u_{\|}}{\partial y}.


The parallel velocity, :math:`u_{\|}`, can be related to the wall shear
stress by,

.. math::
   :label: tauwall-uplus

   \tau_w \frac{u^+}{y^+} = \mu \frac{u_{\|}}{Y_p}.


Taking the derivative of both sides of Equation :eq:`tauwall-uplus`, and
substituting this relationship into Equation :eq:`wall-pk-1` yields,

.. math::
   :label: wall-pk-2

   {P_k}_w = \frac{\tau_w^2} {\mu} \frac{\partial u^+}{\partial y^+}.


Applying the derivative of the law of the wall formulation,
Equation :eq:`law-wall`, provides the functional form of
:math:`{\partial u^+ / \partial y^+}`,

.. math::
   :label: dlaw-wall

   \frac{\partial u^+}{\partial y^+}
         = \frac{\partial} {\partial y^+}
          \left[\frac{1}{\kappa} \ln \left(Ey^+\right) \right]
         = \frac{1}{\kappa y^+}.


Substituting Equation :eq:`law-wall` within Equation :eq:`wall-pk-2` yields
a commonly used form of the near wall production term,

.. math::
   :label: wall-pk-3

   {P_k}_w = \frac{{\tau_w}^2}{\rho\kappa u_{\tau} Y_p}.


Assuming local equilibrium, :math:`P_k = \rho\epsilon`, and using
Equation :eq:`wall-pk-3` and Equation :eq:`utau` provides the form of wall
shear stress is given by,

.. math::
   :label: wall-tauw-equil

   \tau_w = \rho C_\mu^{1/2} k.


Under the above assumptions, the near wall value for turbulent kinetic
energy, in the absence of convection, diffusion, or accumulation is
given by,

.. math::
   :label: wall-tke

   k = \frac{u_\tau^2}{C_\mu^{1/2}}.


This expression for turbulent kinetic energy is evaluated at the
boundary faces of the exposed wall boundaries and is area-assembled to
the nodal value for use in a Dirichlet condition.

Turbulent Kinetic Energy and Specific Dissipation SST Low Reynolds Number Boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the turbulent kinetic energy equation, the wall boundary conditions
follow that described for the :math:`k_{sgs}` model, i.e., :math:`k=0`.

A Dirichlet condition is also used on :math:`\omega`. For this boundary
condition, the :math:`\omega` equation depends only on the near-wall
grid spacing. The boundary condition is given by,

.. math::

   \omega = \frac{6 \nu} {\beta_1 y^{2}},

which is valid for :math:`y^{+} < 3`.

.. _kwsst_high_re_bc:

Turbulent Kinetic Energy and Specific Dissipation SST High Reynolds Number Boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The high Reynolds approach uses the law of the wall assumption and also
follows the description provided in the wall modeling section with only
a slight modification in constant syntax,

.. math::
   :label: wallModelTke

   k = \frac{u_{\tau}^{2}}{\sqrt{\beta^*}}.


In the case of :math:`\omega`, an analytic expression is known in the
log layer:

.. math:: \omega = \frac{u_{\tau}} {\sqrt{\beta^*} \kappa y},

which is independent of :math:`k`. Because all these expressions
require :math:`y` to be in the log layer, they should absolutely not be
used unless it can be guaranteed that :math:`y^{+} > 10`, and
:math:`y^{+} > 25` is preferable. Automatic blending is not currently
supported.

Solid Stress
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The boundary conditions applied are either force provided by a static
pressure,

.. math::
   :label: displacement

   F^n_i = \int \bar{P} n_i dS,


or a Dirichlet condition, i.e., :math:`u_i = u^{spec}_i`, on the
displacement field. Above, :math:`F^n_i` is the force for component
:math:`i` due to a prescribed [static] pressure.

Intensity
~~~~~~~~~

The boundary condition for each intensity assumes a grey, diffuse
surface as,

.. math::
   :label: intBc

   I\left(s\right) = \frac{1}{\pi} \left[ \tau \sigma T_\infty^4 
                     + \epsilon \sigma T_w^4
                     + \left(1 - \epsilon - \tau \right) K \right].

.. _sst_abl:
SST of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following boundary conditions simulate the Atmospheric Boundary Layer, as described in Bautista, :cite:`Bautista:2011` and :cite:`Bautista:2015`. The Nalu-Wind SST RANS implementation matches the Monin-Obukhov profile when used with the model constants from Table-A I-1 (Boundreault, 2011) in :cite:`Bautista:2011` and the meshing method described  in :cite:`Bautista:2015`. The mesh described in :cite:`Bautista:2015` gives the Monin-Obukhov profile for roughness height 0.1. When the roughness height is decreased, the mesh must be refined near the wall. For example, for the :cite:`Bautista:2015` ABL test case using roughness height 0.001 instead of 0.1, the mesh size needs to be halved near the wall. 
    
The :math:`k` and :math:`\omega` boundary conditions are the same as in the :ref:`Turbulent Kinetic Energy and Specific Dissipation SST High Reynolds Number Boundary Conditions <kwsst_high_re_bc>`:

.. math:: k = \frac{u_{\tau}^{2}}{\sqrt{\beta^*}},

and 

.. math:: \omega = \frac{u_{\tau}}{\sqrt{\beta^*} \kappa y}.

The friction velocity, :math:`u_{\tau}` is calculated from a reference velocity, :math:`u_h`, at height, :math:`h`. :math:`h` and :math:`u_h` could, for example, be the hub height of a wind turbine and the velocity measured at that height. 

.. math:: u_{\tau} = \frac{u_h \kappa}{log((h+z_0)/z_0),

where :math:`\kappa` is the Von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n constant and :math:`z_0` is the roughness height.

The momentum boundary condition is a no-slip Dirichlet condition, :math:`u_i=0`, as described in the :ref:`momentum wall boundary conditions <wall_bc_momentum>`.

The streamwise and spanwise boundary conditions are periodic, as described in :ref:`periodic boundary conditions <periodic_bc>`.

The :math:`k`, :math:`\omega`, and :math:`u` wall boundary conditions are set in the input file by specifying a wall boundary condition with ``RANS_abl_bc``. The input file must also specify a height and the velocity at that height with ``reference_height`` and ``reference_velocity``. 

.. literalinclude:: ransAbl_wallUserData.yaml
   :language: yaml

Rather than specifying a momentum source term, :math:`dp/dx`, the velocity is set to the geostrophic (freestream) value near the top of the domain using the ABL forcing method described in :ref:`ABL Forcing Source Terms`. The ABL forcing term is turned on and the desired wind velocity and height must be speciied in the input file: 

.. literalinclude:: ransAbl_momentum.yaml
    :language: yaml

.. _theory_open_bc:

AMS of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following boundary conditions are meant for Active Model Split (AMS) of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) when using SST as the mean (RANS) contribution to AMS. The boundary conditions on :math:`u_i`, :math:`k`, and :math:`\omega` are the same as for SST of the ABL, as described in :ref:`SST of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer  <sst_abl>`. When using this boundary condition for AMS, the energy transfer (LES) components of AMS should be turned off below the sand grain roughness height, :math:`k_s = 30 z_0`, where :math:`z_0` is the roughness height. Below this height the solution from the boundary condition is not necessarily accurate. Therefore including energy transfer components of AMS, such as the active forcing, in this region could introduce errors.

Specifically, the energy transfer components of AMS below :math:`k_s` are turned off by setting the scaling coefficient on the energy transfer contribution to AMS to one, resolution adequacy indicator to one, and active forcing to zero. To turn off the energy transfer components the input file should include:

.. literalinclude:: amsAbl_ransBelowKs.yaml
   :language: yaml 

Open Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Open boundary conditions require far more care. In general, open bcs are
assembled by iterating faces and the boundary integration points on the
exposed face. The parent element is also required since oftentimes
gradients are used (for momentum). For an open boundary condition the
flow can either leave or enter the domain depending on what the computed
mass flow rate at the exposed boundary integration point is.  Two options
are available computing the velocity of the entrained flow---either the
normal velocity at the integration point is used or a specified normal
velocity is used.  The tangential components are always specified.

Continuity
~~~~~~~~~~

For continuity, the boundary mass flow rate must also be computed. This
value is stored and used for the other equations that require advection.
The same formula is used for the pressure-stabilized mass flow rate.
However, the local pressure gradient for each boundary contribution is
based on the difference between the interior integration point and the
user-specified pressure which takes on the boundary value. This can
optionally be modified to be a "total pressure"---removing the kinetic
energy associated with entrainment at the open. The interior
integration point is determined by linear interpolation. For CVFEM, full
elemental averaging is used while in EBVC discretization, the midpoint
value between the nearest node and opposing node to the boundary
integration point is used. In both discretization approaches,
non-orthogonal corrections are required. This procedure has been very
important for stability for CVFEM tet-based meshes where a natural
non-orthogonality exists between the boundary and interior integration
point.

For wind energy applications, the usage of the standard open boundary mass flow
rate expression, which includes pressure contributions, is not appropriate due
to complex temperature/buoyancy specifications. In these cases, a global
correction algorithm is supported. Specifically, pressure terms are dropped at
the open boundary mass flow rate expression in favor or a pre-processing
algorithm that uniformly distributes the continuity mass flow rate (and possible
density accumulation) "error" over the entire set of open boundary conditions.
The global correction scheme may perform well with single open boundary
condition specification, e.g., multiple inflows with a single open location,
however, it is to be avoided if the flow leaving the domain is complex in that a
simulation includes multiple open boundary conditions. A complex situation might
be an open jet with entrainment from the side (open boundary that allows for
inflow) and a top open that allows for outflow. However, a routine case might be
a backward facing step with a single inflow, side periodic, top wall and open
boundary. Not that the ability for the continuity solve to be well conditioned
may require an interior Dirichlet on pressure as the open pressure specification
for the global correction algorithm is lacking. In most cases, a Dirichlet
condition is not actually required as the nullspace of the continuity system
may not be found in the solve.


Momentum
~~~~~~~~

For momentum, the normal component of the stress is subtracted out we
subtract out the normal component of the stress. The normal stress
component for component i can be written as :math:`F_k n_k n_i`. The
tangential component for component i is simply,
:math:`F_i - F_k n_k n_i`. As an example, the tangential viscous stress
for component x is,

.. math:: F^T_x = F_x - (F_x n_x + F_y n_y ) n_x,

which can be written in general component form as,

.. math:: F^T_i = F_i(1-n_i n_i) - \sum_{i!=j} F_j n_i n_j.

Finally, the normal stress contribution is applied based on the user
specified pressure,

.. math:: F^N_i = P^{Spec} A_i.

For CVFEM, the face gradient operators are used for the thermal stress
terms. For EBVC discretization, from the boundary integration point, the
nearest node (the “Right” state) is used as well as the opposing node
(the “Left” state). The nearest node and opposing node are used to
compute gradients required for any derivatives. This equation follows
the standard gradient description in the diffusion section with
non-orthogonal corrections used. In this formulation, the area vector is
taken to be the exposed area vector. Non-orthogonal terms are noted when
the area vector and edge vector are not aligned.

For advection, if the flow is leaving the domain, we simply advect the
nearest nodal value to the boundary integration point. If the flow is
coming into the domain, we simply confine the flow to be normal to the
open boundary integration point area vector. The value entrained can be
the nearest node or an upstream velocity value defined by the edge
midpoint value or by a specified value.

Mixture Fraction, Enthalpy, Species, :math:`k_{sgs}`, k and :math:`\omega` 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open boundary conditions assume a zero normal gradient. When flow is
entering the domain, the far-field user supplied value is used. Far
field values are used for property evaluations. When flow is leaving the
domain, the flow is advected out consistent with the choice of interior
advection operator.

.. _theory_strong_symmetry_bc:

Strong Symmetry Boundary Condition
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two implementations of the symmetry boundary condition: strong and weak. In the strong symmetry implementation, the normal velocity is set to zero at the boundary. Strong symmetry has only been implemented for a cartesian mesh, meaning it can be used for flat surfaces that are aligned with the principle cartesian directions. It cannot be used for curved surfaces or flat surfaces that are not aligned with the principle cartesian directions. Both the strong and weak symmetry boundary conditions have an associated error. In the strong form the associated error lies not on the boundary but in the domain.

.. _theory_weak_symmetry_bc:

Weak Symmetry Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Continuity, Mixture Fraction, Enthalpy, Species, :math:`k_{sgs}`, k and :math:`\omega`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Weak symmetry applies zero diffusion at the boundary for scalar quantities, which effectively sets the boundary-normal gradients of these quantities to zero. This means that, unlike for strong symmetry, in the weak symmetry implementation, normal velocity can be non-zero. This is possible because the cell averaged quantities in Nalu-Wind's discretization are stored at the nodes and therefore reside on the boundaries. In general, a non-zero normal velocity can cause net inflow or outflow. The Poisson solve prevents this by enforcing mass conservation globally to the order of linear solver convergence. 

Momentum
~~~~~~~

A symmetry boundary is one that is described by removal of the tangential stress. For weak symmetry this is done in the momentum equation by applying only the normal component of stress:

.. math:: F^n_x = (F_x n_x + F_y n_y ) n_x,

which can be written in general component form as,

.. math:: F^n_i = F_j n_j n_i.

The momentum equation also penalizes non-zero normal velocity. The strength of this penality depends on the penalty factor. One can enforce a stronger representation of the boundary by amplifying the penalty factor through the `symmetry_bc_penalty_factor` variable in `solution_options`. Its default value is 2.0 which is the minimum required for stability. Amplifying the penalty factor will enforce the boundary in a stronger sense, but can also lead to a more difficult matrix solve as with any large penalty term.

Both strong and weak symmetry boundary conditions have associated error. In the weak form the error manifests as non-zero local velocities at the boundary. As the mesh is refined, the weak symmetry boundary condition converges to the strong symmetry boundary condition (zero normal velocity) with a first order rate. Note that switching from weak to strong symmetry boundary condition does not make the error go away; the error just moves off the boundary and into the domain. The errors for both weak and strong symmetry boundary conditions do go away as the mesh is refined, decreasing with first order rate.

Weak symmetry has not been implemented for Active Model Split (AMS).

If the symmetry type is not specified in the input file then the code defaults to weak symmetry. If the ABL top boundary condition is used and it defaults to symmetry, as described in ref:`Atmospheric Boundary Layer Top Conditions <theory_abltop_bc>`:, then strong or weak symmetry can be specified explicitly in the input file:

.. literalinclude:: symmetry.yaml
         :language: yaml 

Specified Boundary-Normal Temperature Gradient Option
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard symmetry boundary condition applies zero diffusion at the 
boundary for scalar quantities, which effectively results in those scalars 
having a zero boundary-normal gradient.  There are situations, especially 
for atmospheric flows in which the user may desire a finite boundary-normal 
gradient of temperature.  For example, the atmospheric boundary layer is 
often simulated with a stably stratified capping inversion in which the
temperature linearly increases with height all the way to the upper 
domain boundary.  We apply symmetry conditions to this upper boundary for
momentum, but we specify the boundary-normal temperature gradient on this
boundary to match the capping inversion's gradient. 

This is an option in the symmetry boundary condition specification, which 
appears in the input file as:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - symmetry_boundary_condition: bc_upper
      target_name: upper
      symmetry_user_data:
        normal_temperature_gradient: -0.003

In this example, the temperature gradient normal to the symmetry boundary 
is set to -0.003 K/m, where the boundary-normal direction is pointed into 
the domain.

Nalu-Wind does not solve a transport equation for temperature directly, but 
rather it solves one for enthalpy. Therfore, the boundary-normal temperature 
gradient condition is applied internally in the code through application of 
a compatible heat flux,

.. math:: q_n = -\kappa_{eff} c_p \frac{\partial T}{\partial n}

where :math:`q_n` is the heat flux at the boundary, :math:`\kappa_{eff}` is 
the effective thermal diffusivity (the molecular and turbulent parts), 
:math:`c_p` is the specific heat, and :math:`\partial T / \partial n` is 
the boundary-normal temperature gradient.

.. _periodic_bc:

Periodic Boundary Condition
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A parallel multiple-periodic boundary condition is supported. Mappings
are created between master/slave surface node pairs. The node pairs are
obtained from a parallel search and are expected to be unique. The node
pairs are used to map the slave global id to that of the master. This
allows the linear system to include matrix rows for only a subset of the
overall set of nodes. Moreover, a periodic assembly for assembled
quantities is managed via: :math:`m+=s` and :math:`s=m`, where :math:`m`
and :math:`s` are master/slave nodes, respectively. For each parallel
assembled quantity, e.g., dual volume, turbulence quantities, etc., this
procedure is used. Periodic boxes and periodic couette and channel flow
have been simulated in this code base. Tow forms of parallel searches
exist and are supported (one through the Boost TPL and another through
the STK Search module).

Non-conformal Boundary Condition
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A surface-based approach based on a DG method has been discussed in the
2010 CTR summer proceedings by Domino, :cite:`Domino:2010`.
Both the edge- and element-based formulation currently exists in the
code base using the CVFEM and EBVC approaches.

.. _domain-ab:

   :alt: Two-block example with one common surface
   :width: 500px
   :align: center

   Two-block example with one common surface, :math:`\Gamma_{AB}`.

Consider two domains, :math:`A` and :math:`B`, which have a common
interface, :math:`\Gamma_{AB}`, and a set of interfaces not in common,
:math:`\Gamma \backslash \Gamma_{AB}` (see Figure :numref:`domain-ab`), and
assume that the solution of the time-dependent advection/diffusion
equation is to be solved in both domains. Each domain has a set of
outwardly pointing normals. In this cartoon, the interface is well
resolved, although in practice this may not be the case.

An interior penalty approach is constructed at each integration point at
the exposed surface set. The numerical flux for a general scalar
:math:`\phi` is constructed at the current integration point which is
based on the current (:math:`A`) and opposing (:math:`B`) elemental
contributions,

.. math::
   :label: numericalFluxA

   \int \hat Q^A dS = \int [\frac{(q_j^A n_j^A - q_j^B n_j^B)}{2}
       + \lambda^A ( \phi^A - \phi^B) ]dS^A
       + \dot m^A \frac{(\phi^A + \phi^B)}{2} 
       + \eta \frac{|\dot{m}^A|}{2} (\phi^A - \phi^B),


where :math:`q_j^A` and :math:`q_j^B` are the diffusive fluxes computed using the current 
and opposing elements and normals are outward facing. The penalty coefficient :math:`\lambda^A` contains the diffusive 
contributions averaged over the two elements,

.. math::
   :label: lamdbaA2

   \lambda^A = \frac{(\Gamma^A / L^A + \Gamma^B / L^B )}{2}.

Above, :math:`\Gamma^k` is the diffusive flux coefficient evaluated at current and opposing element location, respectively, 
and :math:`L^k` is an elemental length scale normal to the surface (again for current and opposing locations, :math:`A` and :math`B`). 
When upwinding is activated, the value of :math:`\eta` is unity. 


As written in Equation :eq:`numericalFluxA`, the default convection and diffusion term is a
Galerkin approach, i.e., equally averaged between the current and opposing face. The standard 
advection term is given by,

.. math::
   :label: advection

    \int \rho \hat{u}_j \phi n_j dS.

For surface A, the form is as follows:

.. math::
   :label: advection2

   \int \rho \hat{u}_j^A \phi n_j^A dS^A = \dot m^A \frac{ \phi^A + \phi^B}{2},

with the nonconformal mass flow rate given by,

.. math::
   :label: mdotA2

    \dot {m}^A = [\frac{(\rho u_j^A + \gamma(\tau G_j^A p
    -\tau \frac{\partial p^A}{\partial x_j}))n_j^A
    - (\rho u_j^B + \gamma(\tau G_j^B p -\tau \frac{\partial p^B}{\partial x_j}))n_j^B}{2}
    + \lambda^A ( p^A - p^B)] dS^A.

In the above set of expressions, the consistent definition of :math:`\hat{u}_j`, i.e., the convecting velocity including
possible pressure stabilization terms, is retained.

As with the interior advection scheme, the mass flow rate involves pressure stabilization terms. The value of 
:math:`\gamma` defines whether or not the full pressure stabilization terms are included in the mass flow rate expression.
Equation :eq:`mdotA2` also forms the continuity nonconformal boundary contribution. 

With the substitution of :math:`\eta` to be unity, the effective convective term is as follows:

.. math::
   :label: advectionAUPW

    \int \rho \hat{u}_j \phi n_j^A dS^A =
    \frac{ (\dot m^A + |\dot m^A|) \phi^A +  (\dot m^A - |\dot m^A|)\phi^B}{2}.

Note that this form reduces to a standard upwind operator.

Since this algorithm is a dual pass approach, a numerical flux can be
written for the integration point on block :math:`B`,

.. math::
   :label: numericalFluxB

    \int \hat Q^B dS = \int [\frac{(q_j^B n_j^B - q_j^A n_j^A)}{2}
    + \lambda^B ( \phi^B - \phi^A) ]dS^A
    + \dot m^B \frac{(\phi^B + \phi^A)}{2} 
    + \eta \frac{|\dot{m}^B|}{2} (\phi^B - \phi^A).


As with Equation :eq:`numericalFluxB`, :math:`\dot{m}^B` (see Equation :eq:`mdotB`) 
is of similar form to :math:`\dot{m}^A`,

.. math::
   :label: mdotB

   \dot {m}^B = [\frac{(\rho u_j^B + \gamma(\tau G_j^B p -\tau \frac{\partial p^B}{\partial x_j}))n_j^B
   - (\rho u_j^A + \gamma(\tau G_j^A p -\tau \frac{\partial p^A}{\partial x_j}))n_j^A}{2}
   + \lambda^A ( p^B - p^A)] dS^B.

For low-order meshes with curved surface, faceting will occur. In this case, the outward facing normals may 
not be (sign)-unity factors of each other. In this case, it may be adventageous to define the opposing 
outward normal as, :math:`n_j^B = -n_j^A`. 

Domino, :cite:`Domino:2010` provided an overview of a FEM fluids implementation. In such a formulation, the
interior penalty term appears, i.e.,

.. math::

   \int_{\Gamma_{AB}} \frac {\partial w^A}{\partial x_j} n_j \lambda (\phi^A-\phi^B) d\Gamma,

and

.. math::

   \int_{\Gamma_{BA}} \frac {\partial w^B}{\partial x_j} n_j \lambda (\phi^B-\phi^A) d\Gamma.

Although the sign of this term is often debated in the literature, the above set of expressions acts 
to increase penalty term stencil to include the full element contribution. 
As the CVFEM uses a piecewise-constant test function, this term is currently neglected.	

Average fluxes are computed based on the current and opposing
integration point locations. The appropriate DG terms are assembled as
boundary conditions first with block :math:`A` integration points as
:math:`current` (integrations points for block B are :math:`opposing`)
and then with block :math:`B` integration points as :math:`current`
(surfaces for block A are, therefore, :math:`opposing`).
Figure :numref:`domain-ab` graphically demonstrates the procedure in which
integration point values of the flux and penalty term are computed on
the block :math:`A` surface and at the projected location of block
:math:`B`.

A parallel search is conducted to project the current integration point
location to the opposing element exposed face. The search, therefore,
provides the isoparametric coordinates on the opposing element.
Elemental shape functions and shape function derivatives are used to
construct the numerical flux for both the edge- and element-based
scheme. The location of the Gauss points on the current element are
either the Gauss Labatto or Gauss Legendre locations (input file
specification). For each equation (momentum, continuity, enthalpy, etc.)
the numerical flux is computed at each exposed non-conformal surface.

As noted, for most equations other than continuity and heat condition, the numerical flux includes advection and 
diffusion contributions. The diffusive contribution is easily provided using elemental shape function derivatives 
at the current and opposing surface.

   Description of the numerical flux calculation for the DG algorithm. The 
   value of fluxes and penalty values on the current block (:math:`A`) and the opposing block (:math:`B`) are used 
   for the calculation of numerical fluxes. :math:`\tilde \varphi` represents the projected value.

Above, special care is taken for the value of the mass flow rate at the non-conformal interface. Also,
note that the above written form does not upwind the advective flux, although the code allows for an upwinded 
approach. In general, the advective term contains contributions from both elements identified at the interface, 
specifically.

The penalty coefficient for the mass flow rate at the non-conformal
boundary points is again a function of the blended inverse length scale
at the current and opposing element surface location. The form of the
mass flow rate above provides the continuity contribution and the form
of the mass flow rate used in the scalar non-conformal flux
contribution.

The full connectivity for element integration and opposing elements is
within the linear system. As such, for sliding mesh configurations, the
linear system connectivity graph changes each time step. Recent
prototyping of the dG-based and the overset scheme has allowed this
method to be used across both disparate low-order topologies (see
Figure :numref:`dg-hex8-tet4`).
